   -  Expected return
      ...is calculated by extrapolating historical growth out over the next decade, and discounting the future price by the current overvaluation compared to the five-year average P/S.

   -  Value to net income performance
      ...compare the relative valuation of a company to their performance.

   -  Net income margin 
   -  Return on assets
      ...ROA is best used when comparing similar companies or by comparing a company to its own previous performance

   -  Debt to capital

   FCFF = EBIT(1-T) + D&A - d(NWC) - CAPEX{{{
         EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
         ...Sales – Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) – Operating Expenses – Depreciation, Amortisation

      -  T = Effective Tax rate
      
      -  d(NWC) = Change in Net Working Capital
         ... (Current Assets – Current Liabilities) at current period  less (Current Assets – Current Liabilities) at previous period

      -  CAPEX = Capital Expenditure
         ...(Property, Plant and Equipment + Intangible Assets) at current period  less (Property, Plant and Equipment + Intangible Assets) at previous period.

      -  D&A = Depreciation & Amortization

      (equivalent to ... FCFF = net income + D&A - CAPEX + other non-cash items + net gains,losses on disposals of non-current assets)

   WACC = E/V * Re + D/V * Rd * (1-Tc)/*{{{*/
         WACC takes into account the capital structure of the company (i.e. amount of equity and debt) as well as the risk of equity and risk of debt.

      -  E = Value of Equity
         ...E can be determined by taking the 3-month average market capitalisation of the company or market capitalisation as of the reference date

      -  D = Value of Debt
         ...D can be found in the financial statements of the company

      -  V = E + D

      -  Re = Cost of Equity
         ...Re can be estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
         Re = Rf + β(Rm-Rf)
   
         ...Rf is the risk-free rate which can be estimated from the yield of long-term bonds of the in which the company operates (e.g. U.S. 10-year bond yield ~3%)
         ...β represents the volatility of the company’s stock price in the capital markets (can be found in financial statements or real-time stock information providers). Often referred as levered beta.
         ...Rm – Rf is the equity risk premium (long-term return from the financial markets excess risk-free rate)

      -  Rd = Cost of Debt
         ...cost of debt can be estimated through various ways. A common way is to estimate the default spread of the company and add it to the risk-free rate.

      -  Tc = Corporate tax rate

   EV
      -  EV = Enterprise value
         ...sum i=1..n (FCFF[i]/(1 + WACC)^i) + TV/(1 + WACC)^n

      -  TV = Terminal value
         ...FCFF[n](1 + g)/(WACC - g)
